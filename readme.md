# Espy
A social media platform that allows you to find nearby attractions and restaurants.

## Inspiration
Other websites that aid people in finding things to do present the user with a long list of options. While this is great to have all of your options in one place, this can often send the user into their own searching and filtering process based on this long list. Espy takes only the very most highly rated attractions in a town to present to the user.

## What it does
Espy unveils your town in ways that you didn't know it could! Long-time community members as well as visitors can find all the best attractions and restaurants your community has to offer. Just type in the city of choice and explore the very best the town has to offer. The user can contribute to the website by giving their own ratings of the attractions presented which will keep the website true to the users' experiences. 

## How we built it
The team used Replit to collaborate and code the frontend of the website. 
The website frontend is a Vanilla JavaScript application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The backend code is also written in JavaScript. The application is deployed on Azure.

## Challenges we ran into
It was our first time using Azure and creating API functions. There were some issues with Node.js versions being incompatible. However we were able to seek help from our mentor resolve this issue.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of our members is in high school and the two other members are college students. We are very proud of working together despite differences in age, education level, and development experience. Our team also delivered a minimum viable product with the core features.

## What we learned
We learned that a good idea can become a great idea by focusing in on one purpose for the website so that the user understands exactly how the website can help them. We also learned how to take a popular idea and tailor it to make it unique for our users. 

## What's next for Espy
Our next step for Espy is to make it more interactive for the user by allowing them to add any great finds of their own to a town's list which can rise through the ranks by being highly rated by other users. Espy will have many attractions available to browse, but will specifically display the very best.
